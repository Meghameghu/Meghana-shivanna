**Real-time object and lane deviation detection system for autonomous vehicles**
**Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, Geocoder API, Computer Vision
**Project Overview**: Built a real-time object and lane deviation detection system 
for autonomous vehicles using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. Integrated Geocoder API for generating location-based alerts and applied computer vision techniques to detect threats. 
Assigned dynamic risk indices to improve vehicle safety and responsiveness through a Streamlit-based interface.
