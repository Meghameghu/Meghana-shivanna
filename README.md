**Real-time object and lane deviation detection system for autonomous vehicles**
**Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, Geocoder API, Computer Vision
**Project Overview**: Built a real-time object and lane deviation detection system 
for autonomous vehicles using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. Integrated Geocoder API for generating location-based alerts and applied computer vision techniques to detect threats. 
Assigned dynamic risk indices to improve vehicle safety and responsiveness through a Streamlit-based interface.


**Stock price prediction**
**tech stack**:Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
**project overview**:Developed a stock price prediction model using historical financial data and supervised machine learning techniques. T
he project involves data preprocessing, visualization, and model training to forecast future stock prices. Applied algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression to analyze stock trends, a
nd evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score. The system offers insights for potential investment decisions by predicting future values based on past trends.
